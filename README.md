# Web Development Project 7 - *CrewMate APP*

Submitted by: **Nischal Thapa**

This web app: **This app is a web-based tool for managing fictional characters called "Crewmates," allowing users to view, add, edit, and delete crewmate entries. Built with React and Material-UI, it features a gallery for displaying crewmate details like name, color, and speed, as well as forms for creating and updating entries. The app uses Supabase for backend data management, ensuring real-time updates and data persistence in a modern and responsive interface.**
